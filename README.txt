COMP30027 Assignment 1 - Naive Bayes Classifier
Student ID: 1268470

Task 1 is a classical vs pop classifier

Task 2, Q6: modifies the classifier to work with missing data, then runs simulations of how well the classifier works against the % of missing data

To run the code:
- Run the cells from top to bottom as you normally would I expect
	- note that each function is separated into their own cell for easier usage and readability, so ensure no functions are missed*
- As you run the cells from top to bottom, you will reach different sections (Task 1: Q1 then Q2, then Task 2)
	- the relevant cells in those sections will also produce the graphics & statistical analysis used in the written report .pdf

Note that functions are explained by the comments in the .ipynb notebook. Enjoy!
