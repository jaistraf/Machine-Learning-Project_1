COMP30027 Assignment 1 - Naive Bayes Classifier

Task 1 is a classical vs pop Naive Bayes classifier.
By assignment specifications, must report the accuracy, precision and recall of the model.
Then plot the probability density functions P(X|Class = pop) and P(X|Class = classical) for features spectral centroid mean, harmony mean and tempo, then compare.

Task 2, as individual I chose to answer Q6: modifies the classifier to work with missing data, then runs simulations to examine how well the classifier works against the % of missing data

To run the code:
- Run the cells from top to bottom as you normally would I expect
	- note that each function is separated into their own cell for easier usage and readability, so ensure no functions are missed*
- As you run the cells from top to bottom, you will reach different sections (Task 1: Q1 then Q2, then Task 2)
	- the relevant cells in those sections will also produce the graphics & statistical analysis used in the written report .pdf

Note that functions are explained by the comments in Code.ipynb notebook.
